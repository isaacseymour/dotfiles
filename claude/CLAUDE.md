## Pull Request Style Guide

When creating PRs:

- **Title format**: Start with the ticket ID (e.g., "ONC-9125: Fix PagerDuty schedule layer precedence")

- **Description style**: Write 2-3 focused paragraphs that explain:
  1. What the problem was and why it matters
  2. What the core technical issue was
  3. How the fix works at a high level

- **Avoid**:
  - Bulleted checklists
  - "Test plan" sections
  - Verbose AI-generated boilerplate
  - Marketing language or excessive detail

- **Keep it concise and technical**: Assume the reader is a competent engineer who wants to understand the problem and solution quickly
